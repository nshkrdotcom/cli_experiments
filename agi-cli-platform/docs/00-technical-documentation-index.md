## 🔍 Code Examples and Patterns

### **Core Architecture Patterns**

#### **Self-Evolution Engine**
```python
# Core evolution pattern
class EvolutionEngine:
    def evolve_capability(self, description: str) -> bool:
        # 1. Generate code using LLM
        code = self.llm_integration.generate_code(description)
        
        # 2. Multi-layer validation
        if not self.validator.validate_code(code):
            return False
        
        # 3. Dynamic integration
        return self.command_manager.integrate_command(code)
```

#### **Multi-Language Integration**
```cpp
// C++ performance-critical implementation
class CommandExecutor {
public:
    bool execute_with_validation(const std::string& code) {
        if (!validate_code(code)) return false;
        return execute_in_sandbox(code);
    }
};
```

#### **Safety Validation Pipeline**
```python
# Multi-layer validation
def validate_code(code: str) -> bool:
    return (syntax_validator.validate(code) and
            security_scanner.scan(code) and
            llm_validator.validate(code) and
            sandbox_tester.test(code))
```

### **Deployment Patterns**

#### **Container Configuration**
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimization
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
# Build dependencies and virtual environment

FROM python:3.11-slim as production
# Copy only runtime requirements
```

```yaml
# Production-ready deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cli-platform
