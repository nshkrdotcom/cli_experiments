Please analyze the comprehensive documentation in docs/*.md and the current implementation in agi-cli-platform/src/. The documentation describes a full AGI system architecture with advanced security, multi-provider LLM support, and C++ performance implementation, but the current code only implements Phase 1 (basic Gemini integration). Based on the strategic roadmap in docs/06-strategic-roadmap.md, implement Phase 2 features starting with:
Enhanced Security Sandbox - Implement the Docker-based sandboxing described in docs/03-security-validation.md
Multi-Provider LLM Support - Add OpenAI and Anthropic providers as documented in docs/02-self-evolution-engine.md
Advanced Validation Pipeline - Complete the 5-layer validation system from the security documentation
Performance C++ Core - Begin implementing the C++ components outlined in docs/04-performance-optimization.md
Use the existing documentation as your specification and extend the current working Gemini implementation to match the documented architecture. Focus on practical implementation of the Phase 2 objectives from the strategic roadmap.
