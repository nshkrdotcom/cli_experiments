# CLI11 Demo - Self-Evolving C++ CLI Tool

A high-performance C++ implementation of a self-evolving CLI tool using CLI11 framework.

## Features

- **LLM Integration**: Generate new functionality using language models
- **Self-Modification**: Dynamic command generation and execution
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Demonstrate C++ speed advantages
- **Safe Execution**: Multi-layer code validation
- **Configuration Management**: User-customizable settings
- **Command History**: Track and rollback functionality

## Building

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Usage

```bash
# Show help
./build/cli_demo --help

# Check status
./build/cli_demo status

# Run performance benchmarks
./build/cli_demo benchmark

# Demonstrate C++ advantages
./build/cli_demo demo

# Query LLM (requires 'llm' command)
./build/cli_demo query "Suggest improvements"

# Generate new functionality
./build/cli_demo evolve "create a file processor" --save

# Execute commands safely
./build/cli_demo exec "echo Hello World"
```

## Configuration

Copy `config_example.txt` to `~/.cli_evolve_config` and customize:

```bash
cp config_example.txt ~/.cli_evolve_config
```

## Why C++ for CLI Tools?

This implementation showcases several advantages of C++ for system tools:

1. **Performance**: 10-100x faster execution than interpreted languages
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Direct memory management, minimal overhead
3. **System Access**: Native OS API integration
4. **Distribution**: Single binary, no runtime dependencies
5. **Cross-Platform**: Compile for multiple architectures

## Self-Replication Architecture

The tool demonstrates key AGI platform concepts:
- Dynamic code generation using LLM
- Safe execution environment
- Self-modification capabilities
- Learning from user interactions
- Extensible plugin architecture
